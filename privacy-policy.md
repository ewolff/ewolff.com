ewolff.com takes the protection of your personal data very
seriously. We do not collect or store any personal data ourselves.

However, on the one hand, these pages are hosted on servers of third
parties, and on the other hand, content from external websites is
embedded. This always requires that the respective providers perceive
the IP address of the users. Without the IP address, they
could not send content to the browser of the respective user. The IP
address is necessary for the presentation of content. Unfortunately,
we have no influence if third-party providers, for example, store the
IP address for statistical purposes. To the extent that we are aware
of this, we inform users about it.

Inc.](https://www.github.com/), 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St, San Francisco,
CA 94107, USA. Therefore, also note the [GitHub Privacy
