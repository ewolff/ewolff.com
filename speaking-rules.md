title: Rules for Speaker Engaments
---

Generally I enjoy speaking and doing talks. I usually feel honored by
each invitation. However, conferences and other events have very
diverse rules. So I need to figure out what type of conditions I would
accept. I am not trying to give anyone a hard time, so the set of
rules is rather small.

- For public events such as conferences, community events etc. these
  rules apply:
  - **The organizers must not in any way make money directly from any
    speaker.** This includes entrance fees but also indemnifications
    e.g. for not showing up, or trying to rent hotel rooms to speakers
    at higher rates than the hotel usually asks for. **Rationale:**
    Speakers provide the content for the conferences. They should not
    have to pay in addition. It is important to me that not just me
    but none of the speakers pays anything e.g. I won't speak at a
    conference that asks for an entrance fee from any
    co-speakers. Co-speaking engagements are a great way to start are
    career in public speaking. We should support that, not make the
    people pay.
  - Of course, an entrance fee for attendees is fine. But **there must
    be no non-financial prerequisite for joining the event** like e.g. a
    certificate. **Rationale:** While I totally understand that events
    must be economically viable I don't see why we want to limit
    access to this knowledge any further. Actually I wouldn't consider
    such events "public" but rather "closed".
  - It is also **fine to sell speaker-slots**. **Rationale:** Those
    slots might be part of the economic model of the conference. They
    might e.g. help product vendors to advertise their
    products. Organizers believe that these talks do not provide a lot
    of value - otherwise the slots would not be paid-for. My goal is
    to make sure that speakers who provide value to the organizers in
    their own judgement are treated fairly.
	
- **I am more than happy to talk at any kind closed event that e.g. a
  company does e.g. for customers, employees etc.** Such engagements
  would be **paid-for**. Rationale: This creates a value for the companies
  like all other services I provide (training, consulting) which are
  also paid-for.
