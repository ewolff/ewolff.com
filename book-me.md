title: Book Me!
---

For many years I have been consulting software projects and giving
trainings, talks, and keynotes – and I’m always happy to receive
inquiries. 

## Fancy a casual coffee chat?

Simply book [a slot](https://calendly.com/eberhard-wolff-swaglab/) for
a virtual coffee. In a Zoom or Teams call we can get to know each
other and discuss potential collaboration in a relaxed way.

## Consulting for Software Projects

I support software projects in various formats:

- **Workshop**: In a workshop I answer questions about architecture
  and software development. Such sessions usually last half a day or a
  full day and are typically held remotely. Any kind of project
  documentation is helpful for preparation. On request, I can
  summarize and present the results in a separate session to increase
  the value of the workshop.

- **Review**: In a review I examine a project or an architecture in
  detail. An important part of this process includes interviews with
  team members and stakeholders. The findings are compared with
  results from other analyses. The outcome is a clear report with
  concrete recommendations for action.

- **Ongoing Support**: Projects and architectures need continuous
  evolution. What could be more effective than accompanying a project
  in the long run? Often, even a small amount of regular external
  input is enough to sustainably improve a project.

## Talks and Keynotes

For 25 years I have been speaking at conferences – by now I did more
than 500 talks. I have delivered keynotes at events such as the
IT-Tage, XP Days, the Software Architecture Summit, berlin.jar, as
well as many in-house company events. In addition, I regularly
[stream](https://software-architektur.tv) on software architecture
topics.

I am also happy to give talks or keynotes at meetups or in-house
company events, with topics agreed upon individually. Some possible
topics can be found in my [schedule](/schedule.html) and past
[talks](/talks.html).
